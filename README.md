# Purpose
The purpose of this script is to resize a target app image into all of the XCode required app dimensions (167x167, 152x152, etc.) with ease.

# How to use
In the same directory as `resize.py`, include the target image and name it `1024x1024.png`. After you have the image set, you can just call the script and it will create all of the images in the directory.
